# AI USAGE

This document outlines the usage of AI tools in the development of the LoginRadius assignment, focusing on how AI was integrated into the coding process and the overall impact on productivity and code quality.

## AI Tools

- **GitHub Copilot**: Assisted with boilerplate code, documentation, and some thinking around edge cases. (with Claude Sonnet 4)
- **Lovable**: Used for generating some of the initial structure and components in the frontend, but all logic and design decisions were made by me.

## Vibe Coding ?

I am used to a focused approach to coding, ensuring that I understood the requirements and implications of each architectural decision. This helped maintain a balance between speed and quality. I prefer to think through the architecture and design before diving into coding, which allows me to create a more maintainable and scalable solution. I prefer to read blogs and do extensive research about a topic/error, instead of just asking AI to fix it without knowing the root cause. So, all the business logic and architectural decisions were made by me, with AI assisting in the more repetitive tasks and boilerplate generation.

## AI Usage Summary

- **30% AI-generated code**: Mostly boilerplate and documentation.
- **Frontend**: Used AI to generate the initial structure and some components, but all logic and design decisions were made by me.
- **Backend**: I am very hands-on with the backend, so AI was used for writing comments, checking edge cases and test cases, but the core logic and architecture were entirely my own.
